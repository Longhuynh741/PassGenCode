# PassGenCode

https://longhuynh741.github.io/PassGenCode/ <hr>

This Project is aimed towards building upon JavaScript foundations. The completion of this project will require knowledge of several Javascript principles including: Arrays, for loops, if/else statements, and variable creations. You will be tasked with making a random password generator. The generator must be able to follow these criteria:


```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

# Installation

The source code is provided to you. Fork/Copy the files over to your code editor such as Visual Studio Code. The source code will be avalaible in the GT-ATL Bootcamp repository
Once the files are in your code editor you can start to edit the code. 


# Usage

Use VSS code editor to make changes where neccessary. For this project, changes should only be made to the JavaScript file. Make sure the code functions not only on your local branch, but on the published Github website as well.
